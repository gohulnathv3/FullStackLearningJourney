# Travel Planner Application

Creating a Travel Planner application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack can provide you with a robust and scalable foundation. Here's an overview of how you can approach building a Travel Planner application using MERN:

1.  **Design and Planning:** Start by designing the user interface (UI) and planning the features and functionalities of your Travel Planner application. Determine the key components and interactions you want to include, such as destination search, itinerary creation, user authentication, and user reviews.

2. **Backend Development**:
    - Set up your MongoDB database and define the necessary collections to store destinations, itineraries, user data, and reviews.
    - Create a Node.js and Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and API routes.
    - Implement the necessary API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to interact with the database.
    - Implement user authentication and authorization using a library like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    - Set up error handling and validation for incoming requests.

3. **Frontend Development**:
    - Set up a React.js project and organize your components and pages.
    - Create reusable UI components for elements such as search bars, itinerary cards, and user reviews.
    - Implement routing using React Router to navigate between different pages and components.
    - Connect your frontend to the backend APIs using Axios or the native **`fetch`** API to fetch data and perform CRUD operations.
    - Create forms for user registration, login, and itinerary creation/editing.
    - Implement client-side form validation and error handling.
